# Myke's Dotfiles

A place to store my system configuration, shared scripts, etc. Stealing (and feedback!) encouraged :-)

Recently overhauled as I set up a new development environment.

## Setup

To bootstrap a system with these dotfiles run:

```sh
  git clone git@github.com:mykecameron/dotfiles.git
  cd dotfiles
  bin/bootstrap
```
